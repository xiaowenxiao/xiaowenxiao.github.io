# Hello World

My name is Devon Peticolas; I'm an NYC-based Data Generalist who loves functional programming, programming history, and building environments that foster compelling data science. I often speak at conferences and meetups about Data Science and Engineering.

In my spare time, I'm working to perfect the chocolate chip cookie.
